# @getcirrus/oauth-provider

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [#177](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/pull/177) [`ec284fd`](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/commit/ec284fde3544e9ea4e2b6b085f718de449e4862e) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Advertise a `jwks_uri` in OAuth authorization-server metadata and serve an empty JWKS at `/oauth/jwks`. OAuth clients that run JWKS discovery against the metadata endpoint no longer fail when talking to Cirrus. The key set is empty because Cirrus signs access tokens with HS256 (symmetric `JWT_SECRET`) — there are no public keys to publish.

### Patch Changes

- [#175](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/pull/175) [`54ab459`](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/commit/54ab459588393a58ea906977c1ffc8996d8d0700) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fix `parseScope` rejecting valid granular scopes that use the query-only form (e.g. `repo?collection=a&collection=b`) with `Unknown scope resource`. The parser previously only looked for `:` as the prefix delimiter, but per `@atproto/oauth-scopes` syntax a scope can use `prefix:positional`, `prefix?query`, or both. This affected permission sets whose `repo` permission listed multiple collections, since those expand to a single query-form token.

- [#186](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/pull/186) [`22f09de`](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/commit/22f09def6b2ed644fb88b3f707fde4da35a6f04a) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - PAR (`/oauth/par`) now resolves every `include:<nsid>` permission-set scope eagerly and rejects with `invalid_scope` when an include points at a nonexistent or non-permission-set lexicon. Previously the resolver only ran at the authorize step, so clients with a typo in an include scope got a fresh `request_uri` from PAR and only learned about the bad scope at consent time. Matches reference oauth-provider behaviour (`request-manager.ts:297-313`).

- [#184](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/pull/184) [`47c8c1e`](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/commit/47c8c1e401dff16c3983a2151cffd20bc83551d6) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - PAR (`/oauth/par`) now validates `redirect_uri` against the client's registered redirect_uris at push time. Previously the check only ran at the authorize step, which let a malicious caller obtain a `request_uri` for an unregistered redirect even though the subsequent authorize would have rejected it. Reject early per RFC 6749 §3.1.2.4.

- [#185](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/pull/185) [`aed8e1b`](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/commit/aed8e1b629afe9d2eae6d2d5b9c5265d769b057b) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - `scopes_supported` in the authorization-server metadata now lists only the values the spec calls out: `atproto`, `transition:generic`, `transition:email`, `transition:chat.bsky`. Granular resource scopes (`repo:<nsid>`, `rpc:<lxm>`, `blob:<mime>`, `account:<…>`, `identity:<…>`) and permission-set scopes (`include:<nsid>`) are parameterised and aren't enumerable, so bare prefixes like `repo` or `include` are no longer advertised — clients discover support by attempting the scope and falling back on `invalid_scope`, matching the reference PDS.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#158](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/pull/158) [`ec935b1`](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/commit/ec935b16b7f44b22ff325781e0c88ccc3d07e599) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Support granular OAuth permissions and permission sets per the atproto permission spec.
  - `repo:`, `rpc:`, `blob:`, `account:`, `identity:` scopes are parsed and enforced (via `@atproto/oauth-scopes`); `transition:generic` / `transition:email` / `transition:chat.bsky` keep working through the transitional shim.
  - `verifyAccessToken` now accepts a `(perms) => p.assertRepo({ collection, action })`-style check callback in addition to the legacy required-scope string.
  - PDS write endpoints (`createRecord`, `putRecord`, `deleteRecord`, `applyWrites`, `uploadBlob`) assert the matching scope before dispatching.
  - `include:NSID?aud=...` permission-set scopes are resolved via `@atcute/lexicon-resolver` and expanded inline at code-issuance time, so resource-server checks never need network access. The PDS caches resolved permission sets in DO SQLite with the spec's stale-while-revalidate semantics (24h soft / 90d hard).
  - The consent UI groups long granular-scope lists by NSID authority and collapses them behind a `<details>` disclosure, so a 30-scope client like tangled.org renders as a few audit-friendly lines instead of a wall of text. `include:` scopes render the resolved bundle's title/detail.

  **Note on legacy auth:** session JWTs (from `createSession` / app-password flow), service JWTs, and the static `AUTH_TOKEN` continue to bypass scope checks at resource handlers — they're treated as fully-trusted callers per their original semantics (app-password equivalents). The new `rpc:` proxy enforcement only applies to OAuth (`DPoP`) tokens; legacy clients can still call any AppView method via the proxy regardless of granular scopes.

### Patch Changes

- [#155](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/pull/155) [`d1a7074`](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/commit/d1a70748126870274980d76e230719e29f408290) Thanks [@a-lavis](https://github.com/a-lavis)! - Fix two OAuth token refresh bugs that prevented spec-compliant clients (e.g. tangled.org via indigo) from refreshing their session after the access token expired.
  - Track access and refresh expiry separately on `TokenData` (`accessExpiresAt` / `refreshExpiresAt`) instead of a single `expiresAt`. `cleanup()` now prunes by `refreshExpiresAt`, so a row isn't deleted while its refresh token is still valid. The PDS SQLite store migrates legacy `oauth_tokens` rows in place, deriving `refresh_expires_at` as `MAX(expires_at, issued_at + REFRESH_TOKEN_TTL)`.
  - The PDS auth middleware now sends `WWW-Authenticate: DPoP error="invalid_token"` on 401 responses for invalid/expired OAuth access tokens, as required by the atproto XRPC spec. Clients that gate refresh on this header (indigo, and others) will now refresh automatically instead of staying logged-in-but-broken until the user signs out.

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- [#132](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/pull/132) [`e76f1e4`](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/commit/e76f1e40c3a251c778d257b1715b3d56a3ced5a4) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fix OAuth client authentication failures for public clients and mixed JWKS
  - Fix `invalid_client` error for clients that omit `token_endpoint_auth_method` in their metadata (Zod default of `client_secret_basic` was passed through unsupported)
  - Fix `invalid usage "encrypt"` error when client JWKS contains both signing and encryption keys by using jose's `createLocalJWKSet` for proper key selection

- [#134](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/pull/134) [`127f3db`](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/commit/127f3db0f23e2d13ef71a23de6f85a26b1b83c94) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fix OAuth authentication failure for confidential clients whose JWKS contains invalid key_ops

  Clients with ECDSA signing keys that incorrectly declare encryption operations (e.g. `"encrypt"`, `"wrapKey"`) in their JWKS `key_ops` field would fail with "invalid usage" during token exchange.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- [#114](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/pull/114) [`982e067`](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/commit/982e067aec5b7a3ec0f30bdf14146612fabca186) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fix OAuth for localhost clients per AT Protocol spec

  Localhost clients (using `http://localhost` as client_id) are now accepted per the AT Protocol OAuth specification. This enables local development tools and CLI applications to authenticate without requiring a registered client.
  - Added `isLocalhostClientId()` helper to detect localhost client URIs
  - Updated `ClientResolver` to generate metadata for localhost clients dynamically
  - Localhost clients are treated as public clients with no client authentication
  - Redirect URIs must use `http://127.0.0.1` with any port (per spec requirement)

### Patch Changes

- [`7074a27`](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/commit/7074a2707797c6e0d1aace48ab02ca783c43e85e) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Require Pushed Authorization Requests (PAR) for OAuth authorization
  - Set `require_pushed_authorization_requests: true` in server metadata (per ATProto spec)
  - Reject direct authorization requests when PAR is enabled – clients must use `/oauth/par` first

  Fixes #80 (login with tangled.org)

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- [#82](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/pull/82) [`e5507d1`](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/commit/e5507d1ced8ed70e2981b737978d97967e4e8cd8) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fix support for confidential OAuth clients with remote JWKS (like leaflet.pub):
  - Accept issuer URL as valid JWT audience (not just token endpoint)
  - Invalidate stale cache entries missing tokenEndpointAuthMethod

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#77](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/pull/77) [`2ea70ce`](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/commit/2ea70ceb8a52de50787d06e38e1ddb5b31a051d2) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Add private_key_jwt client authentication and fix response_mode default
  - Implement RFC 7523 JWT Bearer client authentication for confidential OAuth clients
  - Add `private_key_jwt` to `token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported` in metadata
  - Support inline JWKS and remote JWKS URI for client public keys
  - Fix default `response_mode` from `fragment` to `query` for authorization code flow
  - Add `userinfo_endpoint` to OAuth server metadata

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- [#63](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/pull/63) [`95ffff6`](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/commit/95ffff6766325822fe621ff82f1c3ab8850dcdea) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fix CSP blocking OAuth authorization flow in Chrome

  Remove `form-action` from CSP due to inconsistent browser behavior with redirects. Chrome blocks redirects after form submission if the redirect URL isn't in `form-action`, while Firefox does not. Since OAuth requires redirecting to the client's callback URL after consent, `form-action` cannot be used without breaking the flow in Chrome.

- [#65](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/pull/65) [`30910f7`](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/commit/30910f71596b04947a0c157acd4bf6edb3a3d298) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Switch to atcute for most internal protocol handling
