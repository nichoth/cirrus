description: Recipes for the failures most likely to show up during install, migration, or daily operation.

This page is organised by symptom. Find the symptom, follow the recipe. For deeper background, the linked concept pages explain why.

## Handle does not resolve

**Symptom:** `pds status` reports **Handle does not resolve**, or `com.atproto.identity.resolveHandle` returns an error.

**Check the DNS or same-host file:**

```bash
# Same-host handle:
curl https://<handle>/.well-known/atproto-did

# Cross-host handle:
dig +short TXT _atproto.<handle>
```

The same-host file should return the DID as plain text. The TXT record should contain `did=did:...`.

**Common causes:**

- DNS has not propagated. Wait. Check from a different network.
- The TXT record's DID does not match the account DID. Compare `pds status` against the TXT record.
- The same-host file is not being served. Cirrus serves this automatically — if it is missing, the deploy is broken. Run `pds status` and check the Worker logs in the Cloudflare dashboard.

For background, see [Choose a handle](/guides/choose-a-handle/).

## Key recovery required

**Symptom:** `pds init` exits with **Key Recovery Required**.

**Cause:** the project directory does not contain the signing key, and Cirrus refuses to overwrite an existing deployment with a fresh key.

**Recipe:**

1. Find the backed-up signing key.
2. Add it to `.dev.vars`:
   ```
   SIGNING_KEY=<the backed-up key>
   ```
3. Re-run `npm run pds init`. The wizard detects the key, verifies it matches the DID document, and continues.

If the key is genuinely lost, see [Back up your signing key](/guides/back-up-signing-key/) for recovery options by DID method.

## Cannot sign in to the Bluesky app

**Symptom:** the Bluesky app returns **Invalid handle or password** or **Could not connect to PDS**.

**Checks:**

```bash
curl https://pds.example.com/xrpc/com.atproto.server.describeServer
```

If the PDS does not respond, the deployment is down. Check the Cloudflare dashboard for Worker errors.

```bash
npm run pds status
```

If the handle does not resolve, fix that first (see above).

**If the PDS responds and the handle resolves but the password is rejected:** set a new password.

```bash
npm run pds secret password
```

This pushes a new `PASSWORD_HASH` to Cloudflare. Sign in with the new password.

## Blob upload fails

**Symptom:** `uploadBlob` returns a 413 or 400 error.

**Common causes:**

- The blob is larger than 60 MB. This limit is enforced by Cirrus. Compress or resize the media.
- The R2 bucket is not bound. Check `wrangler.jsonc` for the `BLOBS` binding. Redeploy if missing.
- R2 is not enabled on the Cloudflare account. Enable it in the dashboard.

## Firehose subscriber stalls

**Symptom:** a subscriber to `com.atproto.sync.subscribeRepos` stops receiving events.

**Recipe:**

- Reconnect with a cursor. The subscriber should track the last received `seq` and pass it as `cursor` on reconnect.
- Check the WebSocket connection state. Cloudflare hibernates idle connections; a well-behaved client reconnects on close.
- Confirm events are being produced. Create a record and watch for an event.

For the wire format, see [The firehose](/concepts/firehose/).

## DID document is stale or wrong

**Symptom:** the network resolves the account to an old PDS or the wrong signing key.

**For `did:plc`:**

```bash
curl https://plc.directory/<did>
```

The returned document should list the Cirrus hostname and the current public key. If it does not, the PLC operation did not land — re-run `npm run pds identity`.

**For `did:web`:**

```bash
curl https://<domain>/.well-known/did.json
```

Cirrus serves this from the Worker. If the public key is wrong, update `SIGNING_KEY_PUBLIC` (a `var` in `wrangler.jsonc`) so it matches the active `SIGNING_KEY`. If the hostname or handle is wrong, fix the corresponding `vars` entry. Redeploy with `npm run deploy`.

## Migration fails partway through

**Symptom:** `pds migrate` errors out during repository or blob transfer.

**Recipe:**

- Re-run `npm run pds migrate`. The CLI resumes from the last checkpoint.
- If the checkpoint is corrupt, run with `--clean` to start over. The target PDS is in a half-imported state until the migration completes.

The source account is not affected until the PLC rotation lands.

## Cloudflare deploy fails

**Symptom:** `wrangler deploy` returns an error.

**Common causes:**

- Not authenticated. Run `npx wrangler login`.
- The R2 bucket name is taken (R2 bucket names are global). Edit `wrangler.jsonc` to use a different name.
- The Durable Object migration is missing. The first deploy creates the Durable Object class; subsequent renames or removals need a `migrations` block in `wrangler.jsonc`. See [the wrangler.jsonc reference](/reference/wrangler-config/).

## When all else fails

- Check the Cloudflare dashboard's Worker logs for runtime errors.
- Check the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/issues) for a matching report.
- Open a new issue with the Worker logs, the `pds status` output, and the version of `@getcirrus/pds` in use.
