- [#97](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/pull/97) [`55fc14f`](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/commit/55fc14fd06de5827fd4cb94ccbdad2145aae6a18) Thanks [@JoshuaACasey](https://github.com/JoshuaACasey)! - Fix missing comma in generated wrangler.jsonc

## 0.0.10

### Patch Changes

- [#95](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/pull/95) [`11d1f70`](https://github.com/ascorbic/cirrus/commit/11d1f70f6f9b11d8632dad2733b229ceb8107a00) Thanks [@ascorbic](https://github.com/ascorbic)! - Fix service JWT expiry for video uploads

  Extended the service JWT expiry from 60 seconds to 5 minutes. This fixes video upload failures where larger videos would take longer than 60 seconds to process on video.bsky.app, causing the callback to your PDS to fail with 401 due to the expired JWT.

  Also enables observability in the Cloudflare Worker template for better debugging.

  The CLI now correctly displays `npm run dev` instead of `npm dev` when npm is selected as the package manager. This ensures users receive valid commands that will actually work.
